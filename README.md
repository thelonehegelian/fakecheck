# FakeCheck 🛡️

## Overview 🌟

**FakeCheck** is a browser extension designed to tackle the ever-growing problem of misinformation on the internet. 🎭 It uses the power of AI agents to analyze and rank the credibility of any given text, tweet, comment, or news article based on its likelihood of being fake.

We blend AI technology with traditional fact-checking methods to provide nuanced assessments rather than simplistic true/false answers. 📊
